        .about-bio

          p I'm a former healthcare professional who is boldly transitioning from roles as an EMT and patient Care/ HSG coordinator into the dynamic world of technology. The decision to pivot from medicine to tech wasn't made lightly. It required courage, adaptability, and a willingness to learn from scratch. However, I immersed myself in coding languages by learning front-end and back-end development.
          p My background in medicine has sharpened my ability to approach problem-solving from unique angles, designing solutions that are both efficient and user-centered. My curiosity and passion for coding have driven me to master HTML, CSS, Python, and FullStack JavaScript, leading to deep satisfaction in crafting visually captivating web applications. Recently, Iâ€™ve leveraged these skills as a freelance web developer for two businesses, God In Your Business LLC and Flawless Designs LLC, where I engineered custom WordPress sites.
          p Away from the screen, you can find me indulging in desserts, mastering a new recipe, and binging Netflix shows.
