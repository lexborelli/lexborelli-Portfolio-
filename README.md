This project handled the "server side" of JavaScript. Created a Portfolio site to showcase the projects I have done.
 The site contains a modern landing page, an about me page with skills, and a series of project pages. 
 
I created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I usedd Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Node.js and Express to:

-Import the required dependencies
-Link the JSON with the Pug templates
-Set up routes to handle requests
-Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
-Handle errors
-Set up a server to serve the project

Additionally, I changed CSS styles to create more of a personalized portfolio for myself, such as; changing the navigation anchor color, the sidebar h5 & p color, the border bottom of the intro paragraph on the home page, and the box shadow color of each cell that showcased my projects.
